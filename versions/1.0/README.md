<h2 align="center">Musicorum Scheme 1.0 </h2>

> This scheme is still a draft

The Musicorum Scheme 1.0 defines the request rules for a standard communication.
#### Table of contents

1. [Workers](#workers)
    1. [Lookup](#lookup)
    2. [Generate](#generate)
2. [Resource Manager](#resource-manager)
    1. [Fetch Spotify Artists](#spotify-artists)
3. [Gateway](#gateway)
    1. [Authorization](#gateway-auth)
    2. [Generate](#gateway-generate)
    3. [Workers](#gateway-workers)
    4. [Status](#gateway-status)


<h2 align="center" id="workers">Workers</h2>

<h3 id="lookup">Lookup</h3>

The lookup connection corresponds as the first connection from the gateway to the worker nodes to define the availability of the nodes and their available themes.

For each node, the gateway must make the following request and response:
`GET https://worker.node/worker`

```js
{
  "name": String,
  "engine": String,
  "version": Float,
  "scheme": Float,
  "themes": String[]
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```json
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

  {
    "name": "rachel",
    "engine": "chloe",
    "version": 1.0,
    "scheme": 1.0,
    "themes": [
      "grid"
    ]
  }

  Response code: 200 (OK); Time: 16ms; Content length: 79 bytes
```
</details>

<br />
With the response, the gateway should map all the themes with their available workers.

<h2 align="center" id="resource-manager">Resource Manager</h2>

This section represents the [Resource Manager](https://github.com/musicorum-app/resource-manager), a micro service managed to cross-match and fetch infromation from external sources (such as Spotify or Deezer), in order to get data that Last.fm API does not provide or it would consume too many requests. This may be applicable for fetching artist images, [audio features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-several-audio-features/), or anything else.
<h3 id="spotify-artists">Fetch Artists</h3>

This request takes a list of artist names and returns a `ArtistResponse` or `null`.

**Request:**
```js
POST https://resource.manager/fetch/artists

{
  "artists": String[]
}
```
<details>

      "Frank Ocean",
      "An artist name that hopefully does not exist"
    ]
  }

Every request made to the Gateway needs to be authenticated and must have this header:

```http
Authorization: <API KEY>

It needs a Last.fm user(represented by `user`), a valid [theme](themes/)(represented by `theme`), a story option, and the `ThemeOptions`(represented by `options`), which is relative to the choosen theme, defined [here](themes/).

**Request:**

```js
