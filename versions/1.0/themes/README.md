Here, each theme will have its own documentation with the data payload it will accept, including examples

### Theme guidelines

Every theme must follow some guidelines. They are:

- If it shows the user name, it should have an option to hide it
- Have a story (9:16) version


And they should be careful about:

- Missing data (for example, an user can have 0 top albums)
- Handle non-latin characters (like korean or japanese letters)
- Handle big texts
